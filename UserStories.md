# UserStories

Short description of your app: Streamlined job search for odd jobs or microjobs.

Required (core) user stories for your app in a bulleted list:
* Scrolling job postings
  * interface like tinder
  * you swipe up or down on job postings
  * presents image, title and brief description or only part of the description 
  * click on this for it to open up like tinder and provide more info
* Creating job postings
  * interface like facebook event event creation
  * place to enter name of person posting job, profile picture, link to social media so you get some sense of the person, job title, job description, image, time/date, location of job, radius from location where you're seeking ppl to apply for job
* Profile
  * not accessible from tab bar at the bottom but a cog/settings like button
  * place for person looking for jobs to present their background/credentials
  * name, profile picture,institution (school or company), link to social media so you get some sense of the person, previous experiences/resume, rating on how well they completed the job
* Matching Carousel
  * like the match screen on tinder
  * person who posted the job sees the matches first
  * only if they decide to speak to the person does it pop up on the job seekers list?
  * on details page is a match button
  * when you match w/ someone in the details page, everyone who tried to match for the job gets removed, the only thing left in the carousel is the card with the job posting
  * this card looks identical to the card presented of the job posting (the page w/ the swipes), and the details page when clicked on is the same as well, EXCEPT, it shows who has been hired for the job, once the "match button" is clicked; also there is a button to close the job
  * when job is over, person who posted the job can click on card for the posting, and close the job
    * when this button is clicked, user is asked if they want to rate the person they hired; if yes, another alert pops up and prompts them to rate the person they hired
  * or the job poster sees second screen, list of ppl who swiped right on the job (they see the profile pic) --> think horizontal scrolling wheel like workplace organization chart --> different lines for different jobs --> shows entire profile of person applying for job, if they like them, swipe up and sends them to messages where they can message the person
  * person who gets accepted for the job saying "you have a match" this is the first message in their communication channel

Optional (nice to have) user stories listed separately:
* Messaging
  * could transfer to Facebook Messenger, text messaging, etc.
* Maps
  * look at jobs based on proximity
